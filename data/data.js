What's on show here across the presentation is an effort to bring together various design aesthetics, from existing brand material, the sites that were listed as references, as well as notes from the first session. Ideally all of this combined into a clean, modern aesthetic that vastly improves the current site design and experience.</p><p>The flow of the homepage is logical, opening like most with a large hero section with tagline text and call to action links nicely framed within the section. As the visitor scrolls they are met with an introduction section and large image links that funnel them to various sections of the site of your choosing. Beyond this is news and event section, with one highlighted news story and a list of upcoming events. As per our initial discussion the homepage has been kept fairly simple, closing out with a quote and final call to action section. As we were hesitant to use \"Apply\" as a link, the final two links are instead just inquiry and visit links, though these can absolutely be expanded in the future.</p>",

Additionally, with this being a fairly static mock up presentation, it can be difficult to preview all of the different interactivity and microinteractions that the design will have. The plan is to have each of the elements on the HP transition in very similar to the referenced Bentley School, or other blackbaud schools with that feature applied. While we can discuss this further, I did opt for a simple drop down menu with accessiblity being the largest factor. If a mega menu is truely desired, we can loop back to this and enhance what's here.</p>",
